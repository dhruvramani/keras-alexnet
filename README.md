# Keras Implementation of AlexNet

A simple implementation of AlexNet in Keras. Architecture same as the one used in [https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/alexnet.py](torchvision). 

### Whyyyy would you implement this?
Googling for the right and a simple architecture was taking a lot of time - hence! Also, community service.
